	* Interop/* : 
		- Redid interops to match FFmpeg rev. 13712
		- Added enums to make most consts typesafe

	* DecoderStream.cs: 
		- Refactored Height and Width to VideoDecoderStream
		- Refactoring and comment updates
	* AVCodec.cs: Added additional overload to avcodec_decode_video to
	allow AVFrame* to be utilized
	* AVFrame.cs: Noted x64 portability issues with
	BrokenPointerAttribute, added conversions to and from AVPicture
	* AVPicture.cs: Noted x64 portability issues with [BrokenPointer]
	* BrokenPointer.cs: Attribute added to mark portability issues to x64
	(need to deal with lack of fixed IntPtr arrays in a later release)
	* SWSContext.cs: Added missing fields from avcodec.h, now works
	properly
	* VideoDecoderStream.cs:
		- Moved to FFmpegSharp.Video namespace
		- Replace IntPtr AVFrame with AVFrame*
		- Utilized fixed SWScale instead of img_convert
		- Moved Width and Height properties from DecoderStream.cs
		- Fixed documentation
		- Eliminated bad try/catch block in destructor

	* Added VideoDecoderStream, and refactored common code from audio and video
	decoding into the DecoderStream base class
	* Added interop classes for the sws_* family of functions in FFmpeg.
	However, I couldn't make these functions work in VideoDecoderStream
	so they have been commented out
	* Tweaked some of the interop method signatures to get them working
	for video decoding

	* Fixed layout of AVFrame
	* Refactored IntPtr's with pointers in a few other structs
	[AVResampleContext, AVSubtitleRect, ImgResampleContext]
